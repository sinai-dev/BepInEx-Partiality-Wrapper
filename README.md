A <b>BepInEx-Partiality Mod Wrapper</b> for Unity Games. This allows Partiality mods to run in BepInEx.

This version is essentially Partiality packaged <b>as</b> a BepInEx mod. It serves as a dummy reference to Partliality.dll for Partiality Mods, but otherwise behaves as a BepInEx mod.

## Install

Installation instructions and the download link can be found here:

## Adding Partiality Mods

Partiality Mod DLL files can be placed in the `BepInEx\plugins\` folder, or the `Mods\` folder.

Other non-DLL files from the mod (if any) should be placed where the author instructs you to.
